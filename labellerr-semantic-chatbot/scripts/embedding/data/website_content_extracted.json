Perform object tracking, segmentation and detection with ease request a demo Video Labeling Tool Label large size of video datasets with automated workflow. Get high quality training data for vision AI and other use case. What is Video Labeling & Annotation? Videos are collection of image frame, which make s it more challenging to label. Video annotation is the process of labeling video clips necessary for training vision models to detect objects. It involves annotating videos frame by frame. Start your free trial Video Annotation Types Labellerr provides multiple type of video annotation. Classification based on single class/multi class or object tracking in a video can be easily handled on our platform. Model-assisted labeling, foundation model based labeling and extrapolating the annotation through the frame can be achieved on our tool.  The key video annotation types are: Semantic segmentation With semantic segmentation one can label each pixel in a video frame into classes.  Everything in the video frame is segmentated, including background features. This helps adding information to every pixel in a piece of video training data. Instance segmentation This annotation type goes one step beyond semantic segmentation by adding more detail to video data. Instance segmentation means that every recurring instance of an object or person is given its unique label and colour. This help to build higher performing AI models. Bounding box annotation This is more basic version of video data annotation, in which each object or person get drawn with a rectangular box. It is most common and fastest method to label video frames. It is used in the use case where high level of precision is not required. Polygon annotation This annotation type allows annotators to capture complex shapes. For polygon annotation labelers connect small lines around an object. This allows them to precisely define the shape of any object or person.This method is essential for segmentation methods. Skeletal annotation This annotation type helps to show the position of the human body in frames of video. To achieve this technique annotators draw lines on human limbs joined together at joint positions. Key points annotation This annotation is primarily used to find body/facial features in video frames. Annotators draw points on key area that helps to identify keyjoint. Bitmask annotation This type of annotation help to mask object with hollow spaces like a circleor ring. Custom annotation Labellerr's platform allows ML teams to combine the annotation methods and techniques shown above to create custom video training datasets. Lane annotation To draw the linear line videoframe for linear structures like roads or pipelines lane annotation techniques can be used. To do lane annotation, labelers draw parallel lines along these structures in each frame of the training video.

Documentation Product and SDK Documentation Pricing Login Schedule a call Smart feedback loop Our labeling engine is governed by a sophisticated and state of the art technology which works as an AI supervisor bot. We call it the “Smart Feedback Loop” . request a demo Computer vision model building is not a linear process, it is an iterative and continuous process. Every iteration’s output gives an outlook on improvement for the next iteration. ‍ The smart feedback loop automates the whole process, making the overall data pipeline more efficient and easy to manage without missing a beat. It stores all the activities, remarks, guideline and see the images, videos at pixel level to make computer vision data pipeline automated. ‍ The feedback loop is a technology to ensure efficient utilization of the AI/ML team's time by optimizing the training data generation process which is possible by automation of data collection, curation and annotation. At annotation level It gives annotators feedback where chances are high of the wrong annotation. It will work on the remarks and corrections given by the reviewer. The system will automatically put itself on alert if any remark sare already given to a similar kind of image previously. At collection level After the annotation system will produce an analysison subjectivity on the label and give power to the MLhead to better assign their expert HITL(Human in theloop) to work on only subjective labels and objectivelabels can be corrected by normal annotaters. At data curation level Based on a pre-trained model or custom production model the system will generate the report on the scenarios in which model accuracy gets reduced and will suggest the kind of image it should annotate in the next batch. The smart feedback loop will run on various pre-trained models and ML techniques to reduce the effort made by the ML team by simply putting automation in place. This assistive technology will help to reduce the cost, time and chances of human errors. It gives ML teams enough space to experiment more with new methods and ideas.

The models trained on these datasets are very large, containing billions of parameters. We must set up an infrastructure/hardware supporting multiple GPUs to train such large models on the massive text corpus. Prepare large and diverse datasets for better language understanding and generation Large and diverse datasets are essential for refining language models, enabling them to generalize across various linguistic patterns, styles, and cultural contexts. These datasets enhance semantic understanding, capture real-world variability, and address biases, contributing to more accurate and contextually relevant language understanding and generation. Learning in Large Language Models What is transformer architecture? The Transformer architecture is particularly proficient in processing sequential text data. It receives a text sequence as input and generates another text sequence as output, exemplified in tasks like translating English sentences to Spanish. Fundamentally, it comprises a series of Encoder layers and Decoder layers at its core. What is the attention mechanism in transformer architecture? The attention mechanism in LLMs is a crucial component that enables the model to concentrate on distinct sections of the input text selectively. This functionality assists the model in prioritizing the most pertinent portions of the input text, enhancing the precision of its predictions. The Power of Large Language Models: Text Generation Capabilities of LLMs in text generation A large language model (LLM) is a deep learning algorithm adept at various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Utilizing transformer models and trained on extensive datasets, these models are characterized by their substantial size. This empowers them to excel in text recognition, translation, prediction, and content generation tasks. Real-life examples of utilizing LLMs to solve problems Large Language Models (LLMs), like FreedomGPT developed by CellStrat, revolutionize diverse applications. Enhancing search relevance, content generation, and market research, LLMs excel in tasks such as answering questions, aiding customer support, and legal analysis. CellStrat offers end-to-end support, empowering businesses to leverage LLMs for transformative outcomes in a data-driven world. Pre-training and Fine-tuning in Large Language Models Pre-training phase Large language models (LLMs) in NLP undergo pre-training, a phase where they are trained on extensive textual data without specific task instructions. Unlike traditional machine learning that explicitly instructs models, pre-training allows LLMs to acquire general knowledge from vast datasets. Following pre-training, the models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. Fine-tuning LLMs to make them perform a specific task The fine-tuning process is broadly divided into the following steps: ‍ Begin with a foundational LLM (e.g., GPT-3). Collect task-specific training data aligned with the intended use case. Specify a training objective for the model (e.g., text classification, generation, or question answering). Train the base model on new data and tasks by updating weights through backpropagation. Evaluate performance on separate holdout data and make iterative adjustments. Deploy the fine-tuned model for practical application. talk to a expert Improving Data Efficiency in Large Language Models How can one enhance the performance of Large Language Models by using limited annotated data? There are various factors that can contribute to enhancing the performance of LLMs- -Emphasizing clarity and precision over the data used, -Contextual understanding, -Temperature parameter adjustments, -Frequency and presence penalties to reduce repetition, -Strategic use of system messages, -Prompt engineering, -Model size considerations, -Iterative refinement strategies, -Addressing inaccuracies, -Seeking human-like responses, -Tailoring output length for precision. What is the difference between transfer learning and semi-supervised learning? Semi-supervised learning operates between supervised and unsupervised learning, utilizing a limited set of labeled samples alongside unlabeled ones to enhance task performance. ‍ Transfer learning entails applying a solution from a known problem to a related new problem, often seen in Deep Learning where pretraining on datasets like imagenet precedes finetuning on the target problem's dataset for improved results. Natural Language Understanding with LLMs How are LLMs able to comprehend and interpret natural language inputs? LLMs, or large language models, demonstrate an exceptional capacity to understand and interpret human language, unraveling context, extracting meaning, and discerning grammar nuances. This advancement enables machines to respond to text in a manner more akin to human understanding. Unlike traditional language models that treat words in isolation, LLMs excel by considering the context in which words appear, creating adaptive word representations based on contextual information. This enhances the accuracy of language processing tasks significantly. Real-life applications enabled by LLMs LLMs possess versatile applications, with one prominent use being generative AI. ChatGPT, an accessible LLM, can generate diverse textual outputs, such as essays and poems, in response to prompts or questions. LLMs, trained on extensive datasets like programming languages, aid programmers by crafting code snippets or completing programs. These models find utility in sentiment analysis, DNA research, customer service, chatbots, and online search. Examples of real-world LLMs include ChatGPT (OpenAI), Bard (Google), Llama (Meta), Bing Chat (Microsoft), and GitHub's Copilot, tailored for coding tasks.

Data Annotation for Autonomous Driving Data annotation requirements to develop self-driving cars Effective data annotation is a crucial element in the advancement of autonomous vehicles. Various tools, including 2D boxing, 3D cube, lane line, polygon, semantic segmentation, and 3D point cloud annotation, are frequently employed to educate machine learning models in identifying objects on the road. Accurate annotations are a must for ensuring safe autonomous driving The greater the accuracy and precision in data annotation, the enhanced safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles as they navigate real-world surroundings. This fundamental process ensures that machines receive precisely labeled data, facilitating flawless decision-making. Lidar and Sensor Data Annotation Importance of the Annotation of lidar and sensor data The annotation of Lidar data involves labeling or tagging point cloud information captured by Lidar sensors, serving as a crucial step that connects raw point cloud data with machine learning models, empowering AI to comprehend and interpret 3D spatial information. Lidar data is instrumental in autonomous vehicles by providing precise and detailed 3D spatial information about the vehicle's surroundings. Role of lidar and sensor data in autonomous vehicles Lidar technology in autonomous systems uses laser pulses to map the environment, calculating distances to objects based on pulse reflection. It rapidly forms a detailed picture, aiding in obstacle detection. ‍ This helps autonomous vehicles to get a better perception of the surrounding environment and thus provide a safer driving experience. Semantic Segmentation Importance of semantic segmentation annotation While image classification clarifies the content of an image, semantic segmentation enables machines to pinpoint exact locations of diverse visual information, discerning the boundaries of each element. Applications of Semantic Segmentation Semantic segmentation, a deep learning algorithm, assigns labels or categories to each pixel in an image, identifying groups of pixels representing specific categories. In applications like autonomous vehicles, it distinguishes objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, pavement, and other road features. In road or lane-detection, accurate semantic segmentation becomes crucial as for the vehicle to accurately move inside the road/lane boundary. Training Data Preparation Data preparation requirement for automotive applications Data preparation in automotive applications involves image pre-processing, including lane-edge detection. Object classification and recognition use techniques like color segmentation, shape-based detection, and machine/deep learning. It addresses image noise from sources like transmission and sensor heat. Edge detection enhances semantic and shape information extraction for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Spliting data into training, validation, and testing sets To ensure effective model evaluation and prevent overfitting, it is essential to split the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets. This separation allows assessing the model's generalization performance and ensures its effectiveness in handling new, unseen data, contributing to robust and reliable model development. Ensuring data quality and accuracy during the annotation process At a broad level, simplifying the response to this question involves breaking down \"data quality\" into three primary attributes: integrity, accuracy, and consistency.

These data can become very helpful to solve multiple real world problems. Computer vision is one such technology that can bring automation to the next level and can perform task that was unthinkable before. Contact us Who we work with Why we're here and How it all started It was 2018, Puneet  (Co-founder & CEO, Labellerr) who spent 7 years leading ML teams in various large enterprises looking for reasons for low AI adoption rate, read an article in Gartner about the global statistics of 80% failure rate of AI project. ‍ He couldn't stopped thinking around it and while discussing with folks in the ML community he found that the report resonates with most expert as well. More discussions suggested that data preparation is THE bottleneck in overall computer vision AI workflow, as it is most time consuming, manual and expensive component. Most ML leaders stated that \"high dependency\" on human-in-the-loop is the key factor for killing the project, . After this insight he and few team members built a technology to bring automation in every stage in computer vision workflow, and called it \"Smart feedback loop\".At first, we shared it with the community and run several iteration to perfect it. In 12 months it got its first enterprise customers and then very quickly few more. Now, we're working on solving problems of enterprise ML teams from automotive, medical imaging and manufacturing by providing a platform on which they can collaborate, ensure data quality and reduce project timeline. If you're solving computer vision problem and working in any of above mention industry, we would love to hear from you. Contact us Our team True professionals ready to help you grow.

Within our internal network, data transmission occurs exclusively over protected channels such as HTTPS and SSH, bolstering the security posture further. Customer Hosting Options: Recognizing the diverse needs of our customers, Labellerr offers flexibility in hosting options. Customers who choose to host their assets with Labellerr benefit from the same rigorous data protection measures applied to labeled data. Alternatively, customers can opt to host their assets on their preferred cloud platform, leveraging various security features like signed URLs or delegated access. This approach empowers customers to extend their existing cloud platform security policies seamlessly to the Labellerr platform. Least Privilege and Monitoring: At Labellerr, we adhere to the principles of least privilege and need-to-know, ensuring that access to customer data is restricted only to individuals with authorized roles and responsibilities. Our access controls are meticulously crafted to align with best security practices, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access. Additionally, we maintain comprehensive logs of access activities within our cloud infrastructure, facilitating ongoing monitoring and security assessments to promptly address any potential threats or vulnerabilities.In conclusion, Labellerr is dedicated to upholding the highest standards of data security and privacy. Our robust encryption protocols, stringent access controls, and proactive monitoring mechanisms collectively contribute to the safeguarding of customer data.

      "Labellerr has a flexible pricing model, which can be useful for businesses with a range of labeling requirements. Additionally, Labellerr offers a smart feedback loop that can assist in enhancing labeling accuracy over time. Last but not least, Labellerr provides a free trial that might be helpful for businesses who want to try the product out before committing to a premium plan.",
      "You can utilize either Labellerr or Amazon SageMaker for small-scale data labeling projects, but the decision will be made based on the particular needs of the project. Labellerr is an excellent option if the project calls for high-quality labeled data and human annotators because it is primarily focused on data labeling. On the other hand, Amazon SageMaker can be considered for managing a whole ML process.",
      "In contrast to Amazon SageMaker, which charges per labeled item and provides two plans for data labeling, Labellerr offers variable pricing and a free trial. Unlike Sagemaker, our pricing is very transparent and predictable while scaling up.",
      "Both Amazon SageMaker and Labellerr provide automatic data labeling solutions. However Labellerr provide most extensive automation from generative AI to model-assisted labeling.",
      "You can create unique labeling processes by combining Labellerr with Amazon SageMaker. While SageMaker Ground Truth offers personalized labeling procedures, Labellerr delivers high-quality labeled datasets. You can manage and automate labeling processes with Labellerr and SageMaker Ground Truth, train ML models on labeled datasets, and accelerate the machine learning development process.",
