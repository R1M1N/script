The answer lies in image segmentation.\n\nIn this video, we show you how image segmentation works using Labellerr. We annotate an image step by step—segmenting the lady, the man, and the background. It’s fast, accurate, and flexible.\n\nBut no model is perfect. We reveal a real-world limitation of Segment Anything Model (SAM)—where a hand gets skipped due to occlusion—and show how to fix it using Labellerr’s eraser and group tools. You’ll see how you can easily reassign annotations so your AI learns the right object relationships.\n\nWe also touch on CLIP mode, a feature that helps you close tiny gaps between objects for pixel-perfect segmentation\n\nChapters\n0:00 Introduction to Image Segmentation\n0:22 Uploading and Annotating the Lady\n0:31 Segmenting the Man\n0:36 Segmenting the Background\n0:44 Reviewing Annotations\n0:47 Identifying SAM's Limitation\n0:58 Fixing Errors with Eraser Tool\n1:11 Adding New Annotations\n1:14 Using Group Tool for Object Relationships\n1:27 Closing Gaps with CLIP Mode\n1:52 Final Segmentation Results\n1:59 Learn More and Book a Demo\n\nInterested in learning more about our services? \nWebsite: https://www.labellerr.com\nBook a Demo: https://www.labellerr.com/book-a-demo\n\nFind us on Social Media Platforms:\nLinkedIn:   https://www.linkedin.com/company/labellerr\nTwitter: https://x.com/Labellerr1",

When datasets are poorly annotated, AI models learn those same mistakes.\n\nIn this video, we’ll show you exactly how to fix those errors using Labellerr. We start with a pre-annotated image of a hand and walk you through correcting misplaced keypoints, adding missing parts like the wrist, and cleaning up unnecessary annotations. You can also adjust things like the size and transparency of dots for better clarity.\n\nWhether you're switching from another tool or starting from scratch, Labellerr adapts to your workflow. It supports both raw and pre-annotated uploads and gives you full control over the annotation process.\n\nInterested in learning more about our services? \nWebsite: https://www.labellerr.com\nBook a Demo: https://www.labellerr.com/book-a-demo\n\nFind us on Social Media Platforms:\nLinkedIn:   https://www.linkedin.com/company/labellerr\nTwitter: https://x.com/Labellerr1",

Reducing the daily tasks that took hrs to a few minutes.\n2. Much better accuracy can be ensured\n3. Remove the dependency on allocating multiple reviewers on a daily basis\n4. Speed up the whole data generation process.\n\nSee a quick demo below-\n\nHappy annotating!!!\n\n#projectmanagement #qualityassurance  #highquality #data #trainingdata  #costreduction #computervision #dataannotation",

    "description": "Humans can quickly understand the intent of the features like the color of the poster, expressions on the face of the actors to appropriately decide genres like horror, comedy, drama, documentary, etc. Let us take examples of popular video streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, and Hulu have already adopted use cases related to genre prediction like:\n\n1. Personalized movie recommendation.\n2. Automatically generating thumbnails.\n\nOur problem statement acts as a base for the above use cases. When we predict the movie genre using a poster then it directly helps the streaming service provider to create personalized movie recommendations upon the viewer’s past history. \n\nAlso, different thumbnails are shown to different viewers for the same movie or a TV show based upon what type of genre the viewer usually prefers.\n\nEarlier some of them used the traditional machine learning approach to solve the problem. The main motive was to predict the movie genre from the plot summaries. The traditional approach involved using Naive Bayes and RNN to predict the movie genre using plot summaries. Another approach to solving the problem was to use the Bernoulli event model to learn the likelihood of a genre using movie ratings.\n\nChallenges in the current scenario:\n\n*There were several challenges that were encountered using the traditional machine learning approach. \n* The audience was more likely to make decisions using posters rather than movie ratings or plot summaries. So, this approach was not much effective to create customized advertisements and recommendations for the audience.\n* Since the visuals are more effective and convincing in making a decision hence the prediction using plot summaries which basically involves text is very naive. \n* According to PwC, there is a decline of -65.9% in year-on-year box office revenue in the year 2020. Also, total revenue of US$ 22.6 Billion was generated by OTT in the year 2020 in the US [Source].\nWhat are the solution and new ways of solving the problem?\nHumans are correctly able to identify the genre of a movie by just looking at it. We can suppose that the different characteristics of the posters such as colors, text-based features, facial expressions of the actors, can be used as input features to our CNN-based deep learning models.\nInspiration of our approach\n\n1. Color plays an important role in deciding the genre of the movie.\n2. Facial expression is a very important factor in the prediction of movie genres using posters.\n3. Animated Movies can be predicted using just colors and poster type.\n4. Raw pixels contain very important information about the image.\n\nThe core AI solution:\n\nCNN-based image classification models are one of the techniques for performing multi-label classification. CNN-based have been proved to outperform every other traditional machine learning algorithm. \n\nThe deep learning model is trained using a dataset that contains three classes namely action, comedy, animation, war, fantasy, history, romance, documentary, science fiction, war, mystery, fantasy, drama, etc. The images are normalized before using them for training our CNN-based deep learning multi-label image classification problem. \n\nThen the final trained model is tested on the testing data and the performance is recorded. Another technique that can be used for the task is the transfer learning technique. The models having complex architecture and these models are already trained on a much larger dataset. These models can be fine-tuned on the dataset of our choice for the genre prediction.\n\nPossible impacts made by our solution:\n\nThe internet advertising market in the United States is expected to reach a value of US$ 153 Billion by 2024. Although, during the pandemic, the revenue reduced from US$ 125.2 Billion to US$ 121.0 Billion in 2020. \n\nHence, our solution is a possible approach to get customers more involved in the advertisements which will, in turn, increase the total revenue of the entertainment industry. Also, the effective cost involved in the advertisement will reduce too because the history and past interaction details of the target viewers are already available. [Source]\n\nAnnotating the dataset on the Labellerr:\n\nTo prepare a dataset for your model you don’t need to try out the hectic approach of manually performing the data annotation. Leave all your problems and tensions on Labellerr. \n\nHere is a demo video that will walk you through the process: https://blog.labellerr.com/index.php/2021/04/07/revolutionizing-the-entertainment-industry-for-better-customer-",

    "description": "47% of return, refund, and exchanges occur because the product does not fulfill the customer’s expectations.\n\nA Global web index report highlights that 56% of clothing/ shoes sold online were returned just in the year 2019.  The increased rate of returns not only concerns the retailer but increases the load on the customer side as well. 33% of online retailers admit that they offer free returns but offset the cost of returns by charging for delivery and 20% said they would increase the cost of the product to cover the return expenses.\n\nComputer vision AI-driven fashion landmark technology is one of the ways. Fashion landmark detection aims to predict the positions of functional key points defined on clothing, such as the corners of the neckline, the hemline, and the cuff. \n\nNot only do these landmarks indicate the functional regions of clothing, but they also implicitly capture their bounding boxes, forming the design, pattern, and category of clothing.\n\nScale variations and non-rigid deformations in clothing lead to increased challenges in more complex patterns than restricted deformations, makes landmark detection even more data-hungry to satisfy algorithms and this differentiates it from known pose estimation.\n\nNow you wonder, the solution is good but how to access good quality&nbsp; labeled data for training the model.\n\nHere’s your solution - http://www.labellerr.com\n\nWait are you wondering how to get this integrated within a few weeks into your production system without investing in building an AI team!\n\nVisit our website at http://www.labellerr.com and mention your use case in brief and our customer engineer will contact you and help you prepare the plan and get you running on a trial with us to validate. \n\nMail us at labellerr@tensormatics.com for more info.",

Using computer vision they identified ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ spots on the shelf and used this to ascertain which SKU should hold the prime positioning.\n\nIn a particular store, they experimented with placing the same product at eye-level in all the rows (1,2,3 &amp; 4). Interestingly they observed that the product was picked up from row 2 more than all the other rows.\n\nSuch granular observations need real-time monitoring of customer touch-points. It was done using computer vision technology coupled with data annotation and the best planogram was designed.",
